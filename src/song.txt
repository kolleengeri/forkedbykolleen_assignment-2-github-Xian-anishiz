# Eleven Eleven
### Artist: Conan Gray
### Album: Wishbone (2025)

### Song Meaning:
Conan Gray's song "Eleven Eleven" from his album Wishbone is about the 
lingering pain of a breakup and the desperate search for signs that the 
relationship could be rekindled, mirroring the superstition of making a 
wish at 11:11. The song expresses the psychological difficulty of moving 
on, the clinging to small moments and coincidences as symbols of connection, 
and the melancholy hope that a wish at the numeric time could bring the 
lost love back.

### Verse 1
Shooting star on the night we first kissed
Like a sign, if I blink, you'll be missed
In my mind, you and I still exist
It's a thought that is dangerous

### Pre-Chorus
'Cause I'll wait forever
I won't look for better
I'll find signs for you and I
Oh, for you and I

### Chorus
Well, there's wishbones and clovers and numbers from Heaven
Shapes in the stars to invent our connection
As much as I act like I want to forget it
I still wish for you at eleven-eleven
I still wish for you

### Verse 2
Heard you're seeing some girl in New York
So, what am I reading horoscopes for?
You're still wearing those fucked-up white Nikes
So, maybe you're superstitious like me

### Pre-Chorus
'Cause I'll wait for nothing
Pretending we're something
My mind lies for you and I
Oh, for you and I

### Chorus
There's wishbones and clovers and numbers from Heaven
Shapes in the stars to invent our connection
As much as I act like I want to forget it
I still wish for you at eleven-eleven
I still wish for you
I still wish for you

### Bridge
Wishbones, clovers, salt spilling over
Why don't you come back? That shit's over my shoulder
There's black cats, broke glass, cracks on the pavement

But I just can't accept that it's too late to save us

### Chorus / Outro
There's wishbones and clovers and numbers from Heaven
And if you'd ask me, I'd deny that we ended
As much as I know that it's time to forget it
I still wish for you at eleven-eleven
I still wish for you at eleven-eleven
I still wish for you (for you)
